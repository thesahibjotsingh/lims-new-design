// lib/doctors.ts
//
// The LIMS consultant roster. REAL PEOPLE, REAL REGISTRATION NUMBERS.
//
// Rules for this file, in order of importance:
//
//  1. Never add a field LIMS has not supplied. No invented years of experience, no
//     invented OPD timings, no invented biography, no invented languages. A missing
//     field renders as a missing section — the UI is built for that. A guessed field
//     renders as a fact about a named doctor's credentials, which is a real harm and,
//     for a registration number or a qualification, arguably a legal one.
//
//  2. Registration numbers are stored verbatim as issued, including the council
//     prefix. They are the field a patient uses to verify a doctor against the
//     council register, so a "tidied" number is a broken number.
//
//  3. `departmentSlug` must resolve against lib/services.ts. A doctor filed under a
//     slug that does not exist there disappears from the department page silently,
//     which is why assertDoctorDepartments() below runs at module load.
//
//  4. `portrait` must end up holding a photograph OF THAT CONSULTANT and nothing else.
//     A stock face captioned with a real, registered doctor's name is an invented
//     likeness of that person, and rule 1 covers it as squarely as an invented
//     qualification would be.
//
//     ALL FOUR PORTRAITS BELOW ARE STOCK PLACEHOLDERS AND MUST NOT SHIP. They are in
//     place so the client demo shows the finished card design, on the same footing as
//     the stock photography in lib/media.ts. Before launch, either replace all four
//     with photographs of the actual consultants or delete the `portrait` lines —
//     DoctorCard renders a finished monogram card without them, which is why leaving
//     the field out costs nothing.
//
//     Known problems in the current placeholders, so nobody rediscovers them:
//       - shweta-godara   carries a visible Dreamstime watermark (unlicensed comp).
//       - vikash-raj      is a photograph of a woman.
//       - udit-choudhary  and vikash-raj were upscaled from sources far below the card
//                         size, so both look soft.
//
//     Pipeline: assets-source/doctors/dr-<id>.png -> public/doctors/<id>.webp, written
//     by scripts/build_assets.py as a 4:5 crop at 800x1000. Drop the real photographs
//     in under the same names, re-run the script, and nothing in this file changes.
//
// Phase 3 moves this behind the CMS or HIS loader. The shape stays the same.
